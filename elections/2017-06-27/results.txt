  As Cast:    * First, if a candidate for the office of Tailor pledges to award me a grAy ribbon in eir next monthly report if they become Tailor, I cast my first-priority votes for that candidate. If there is more than one such candidate, preference is given to the earliest such pledge.
   * Next, the final candidate before the vote is closed who transfers me a Shiny for the purpose of securing my vote is awarded my second-priority votes. (Which, to clarify, if the first priority votes are empty, the second-priority votes de facto become first-priority votes)
   * Otherwise, I vote PRESENT.
